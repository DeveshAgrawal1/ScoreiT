# ScoreiT
This is a simple score fetcher which fetches cricket scores from cricbuzz.com.
The program can now, fetch live results, matches which are scheduled for later days, and also results of recently concluded matches.
It can also display information like series going on, the venue of the match and other information as well.

To do :
- [x]As when I wrote this program, no matches were the ones which were to be played later on, code for that case has to be added.
- [ ]Add a GUI.
